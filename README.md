About (Short Description / Summary):It has been found more than 2 billion people worldwide are now overweight or obese.These are people who work five days a week and hardly have time even for their near and dear ones. India has the world’s largest share of diabetic patients and it is mostly attributed physical training among developed and developing nations. But in a country like ours you will be shocked to see the number of college students, young corporate people and even a high share of people who are over 30 years of age playing games like cricket, badminton and football during weekends in the various city playgrounds and parks. They wait for an entire week so that they can catch up with their old friends and have a competitive day of sports on weekends. But after a while it gets boring to play with the same 6-7 people and gradually they stop playing any game and when this happens they have virtually no exercise. 
 Our application has a simple aim of providing people with a chance to meet like-minded people who share their interests and provide a competitive environment which would help them de-stress and also provide them the much needed physical activity which would keep them healthy in the longer run. We aim to achieve this by providing a very simple app which would help the users to create an individual or team account and create an event or match with specifics such as sport, time, and venue. Anyone who has a team which matches the requirements can fix a match with the opponent using the application.
